For the DriverPass project I had to retrieve the requirements needed to design and implement a system for them. I had to retrieve the different users who would be utilizing the system and how it would be interacted with from the client's customers.
I particularly did well in finding out what the clients requirements were for the system. I was able to piece clues together to develop a system that met all the requirements.
If I had to choose one part of the project to revise it would've been the powerpoint presentation. I could've done a lot better in utilizing my notes to explain the diagrams better, and I could've also presented better understandable diagrams for the audience.
I interpreted the users need and implemented them into my design by understanding what those requirements were, and also visualizing how it would be maneuvered by the users. Easy to use and understand is something all systems need when working with customer-based systems. Considering the user's needs are very important to ensure what they're wanting is fulfilled into their system. Being able to plan out a design that has the client's needs in mind will result in fulfilling the client's requiremrnts.
When designing software, I ensured all requirements and needs were met, and that it was functional and understandable to users. In the future I will ensure to have multiple references and designs to make sure I have all necessary outputs in mind.
